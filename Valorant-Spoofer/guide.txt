First of all open the Folder "Valorant - Remove HWID" and open the Valorant Spoof
After that open the Cleaner by admin rights

After all of that steps return to the VALORANT SPOOFER folder and open CMD by Admin rights
After opening of CMD use command "cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Valorant-Spoofer"
and use command "AMIDEWINx64 /SU /BS"
After that use "AMIDEWINx64.EXE /SU auto" and "AMIDEWINx64.EXE /BS (your number of BS but change 1-2 numbers)"

After that steps you need to open the folder VolumeID and all of programs copy to disc c:
After it you need to open CMD and use "cd c:". -> "vol c:" "vol d: (if you have disc D)"
For example, vol c: told me that my hwid is 848C-0093. I write in cmd "volumeid c: 848C-4393 (I change the 2 numbers)" and like this you need to do with disk d

After all of that you need to download any mac address changer and change all of your mac addresses. After it you need to reboot your pc and open valorant
